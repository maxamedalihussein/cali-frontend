# CALI DAYAX Wheels Tracker - Todo List

## ✅ COMPLETED FEATURES

### 🔐 Authentication & Security
- ✅ Lock down registration and allow only 2 users (Mohamed and Dad) in MongoDB with hashed passwords. Remove or block all registration endpoints. Use JWT for authentication.
- ✅ Implement secure login endpoint (JWT, bcrypt), update email/password endpoints, and forgot password (email verification) endpoint in backend. Setup nodemailer for email sending with env vars.
- ✅ Protect all backend routes with JWT middleware. Validate all forms and sanitize inputs. Do not expose user data in responses.
- ✅ Create a modern, responsive login page with CALI DAYAX branding, error handling, loading spinner, and mobile support. Add forgot password, change email, and change password flows. Support dark mode.
- ✅ Ensure session persistence with JWT in localStorage. User stays logged in after refresh. Test all auth flows for security and privacy.
